The Greenhouse Quality Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to help authorities monitor air pollution levels emitted from industries in real time. The system is equipped to measure critical environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and toxic gas levels (CO‚ÇÇ, NH‚ÇÉ, etc.) within and around factory environments.
When pollution levels exceed predefined safety thresholds, the system automatically sends alert messages to higher authorities, who can then take immediate action ‚Äî including issuing fines or warnings to the violators. This ensures transparency, accountability, and proactive pollution control, helping contribute to a cleaner and safer environment.
