                                                      üè≠Greenhouse Quality Monitoring System

The Greenhouse Quality Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to assist authorities in real-time monitoring of air pollution levels emitted by industrial facilities. The system continuously tracks key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and the concentration of toxic gases like CO‚ÇÇ and NH‚ÇÉ within and around factory premises. When any of these readings exceed predefined safety thresholds, the system automatically sends alert messages to higher authorities, enabling them to take swift action, such as issuing fines or warnings to non-compliant units. The application is built using HTML5 to structure the web interface, CSS3 for crafting a responsive and user-friendly design, and JavaScript to implement dynamic client-side functionalities such as real-time data updates and user interaction. Firebase is integrated as a backend solution to manage the database of sensor readings and facilitate the delivery of alerts in real time. Together, these technologies create a powerful and efficient platform that promotes transparency, accountability, and proactive pollution control, contributing to a cleaner and safer industrial environment.
